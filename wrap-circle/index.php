           <h2>Spanish Art</h2>
           <p>Spanish art has been an important contributor to Western art and Spain has produced many famous and influential artists including Vel√°zquez, Goya and Picasso. Spanish art was particularly influenced by Italy and France during the Baroque and Neoclassical periods, but Spanish art has often had very distinctive characteristics, partly explained by the Moorish heritage in Spain (especially in Andalusia), and through the political and cultural climate in Spain during the Counter-Reformation and the subsequent eclipse of Spanish power under the Bourbon dynasty.</p>
